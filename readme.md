To run, be sure to have perl 5 installed on whatever machine you have (should be compatible with all OS's, but it was only tested on windows

run by using:
	perl roomingHelp.pl
	
The CSV files included are not necessary to run the program but are included in order to make testing easier. Just put them in the same folder as roomingHelp.pl 
The program will automatically create them if they are missing.
